# Corporate-Business-Performance-Insights

# Problem Statement

  This is a project-based learning course. We will use an imaginary company called AtliQ Hardware and discuss its business model. 
  It is a consumer goods electronics company having operations in various countries. Their business is growing rapidly and they
  still rely on excel files for data analytics. Excel files are hard to consume and not effective in generating insights. Also
  due to the lack of effective analytics the company faced a major loss in Latin America.

  Senior executives of this company have decided to invest in a data analytics project and have assigned a team for this work.
